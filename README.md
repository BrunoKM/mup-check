# µP Implementation Check
A tool for evaluating the correctness of a µP initialization implementation from [Tensor Programs V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03466).

# Why?
Implementing µP is tricky. There are lots of caveats that are easy to miss: vector multipliers such as those `LayerNorm` need to be initialised with mean `1`; if you're using a Transformer with weights shared between the input and output layers, you can't use the *[Table 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03466.pdf)* variant of µP. At the end of the day, how do you know you've done it correctly?

Thankfully, µP should satisfy a range of desirable conditions that can be empirically tested.
µP is the only parameterisation that ensures the scale of changes to weights and internal activations remains roughly constant as you scale up the model.
This package provides tools and set of instructions for evaluating whether these conditions hold true to simplify the process of checking whether you µP implementation is correct!

### Why not provide a package for µP?
Implementing a generic package for applying the µP initialization is hard. It's difficult to do it in a model agnostic way. There are often many caveats; for example: you can't use the *[Table 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03466.pdf)* version of µP when implementing a Transformer with weights shared between the input embedding and the output readout layer. But if you're using the Table 8 or Table 9 variant, you need to modify your model with multipliers! Hence, with any package or implementation, there will be an onus on the user to modify their model to use µP correctly.
